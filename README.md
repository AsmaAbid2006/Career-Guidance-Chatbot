# Career-Guidance-Chatbot
A chatbot that suggests career paths based on user interest.
This chatbot project has two main files. 
1. app.py
2. train_model.ipynb.
Save both files in a same folder .
run train_model.ipynb file first. It will save two more files in the same folder which are intent_model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl.
Now run the app.py file.
For this file, you need to install streamlit using pip and then you have to run the file using streamlit. for example in your console you have to write this statement: streamlit run app.py.
We are using streamlit because we have to make an interface for our chatbot so streamlit opens a localhost in our web.
Note: I made app.py file a python file because streamlit only runs in python files not in jupyter files.
So, you can turn train_model.ipynb into a python file according to your own ease.
This project needs a datset which you can download from the following link
